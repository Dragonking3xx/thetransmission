		<text>As the spikes pierce your host body, you realise that holes in these humans seem like a bad idea. Fluids leak out, and you fizzle away.</text>

		<text>Commander Jones draws a pistol and shoots you twice. Maybe you should have learned more about this world? Put it down to experience. Oh, wait.</text>

		<text>Congratulations, you�ve found the first piece of semi-advanced technology! As your host body disintegrates, you are dragged along with it, becoming one again with the great universe.</text>

		<text>Talking isn�t your strong point, is it? He shoots you twice, and as the life drains from your host body, you also disintegrate.</text>

		<text>The air itself seems to eat away at you, and you struggle to get away - but there is nothing. You succumb to the poisonous atmosphere. Maybe a transfer wasn�t the best idea.</text>
